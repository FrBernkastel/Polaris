#### Functional Requirements
* User can click the unknown block for exploring this safe area.
* User can mark the unknown block as a potential 'mine'.
* The UI should give the real-time feedback of the known and unknown blocks, including:
  * Empty block - there are no mines around its eight-direction neighbours.
  * Number block - there are # mines around its eight-direction neighbours.
  * Flag block - marked by user to assume it is a mine.
  * Mine block - appears when the user click the 'mine' block.
* Before the game, the user can decide the size of the map and the number of mines.
* The user can restart the game at anytime.
* The game has a timer system, which will record the user's spending time. There is a billboard for the user's history achievements.
